# Simple Snake Game in C++ and Python

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a basic snake game in two programming languages: C++ and Python. The game features a snake that grows in length as it consumes fruits, and the objective is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Features
- Control the snake using the keyboard (WASD or arrow keys).
- Randomly placed fruits that increase the snake's length and the player's score when consumed.
- Continuous boundary; the snake passes through one wall and comes out of the opposite wall.
- Score tracking displayed on the screen.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with itself.

## Technologies Used
- C++ (for the C++ version)
- Python (for the Python version)

## How to Run
### C++ Version
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Compile the C++ code.
3. Run the compiled executable.

### Python Version
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the Python script in a terminal or command prompt.

## Controls
- `W` or `Up Arrow`: Move Up
- `S` or `Down Arrow`: Move Down
- `A` or `Left Arrow`: Move Left
- `D` or `Right Arrow`: Move Right
- `X`: Exit the game
